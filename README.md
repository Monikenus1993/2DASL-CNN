# Our (2D-Assisted Self-supervised Learning) 2DASL has been submitted to ICCV2019, the arxiv version is available: https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.09359

To facility the research in the community of 3D face reconstruction and 3D face alignment, we will release our source code, including the pytorch code for testing (training code will be available upon the acceptance of our paper), the matlab code for 3D plot, rendering and evaluation. The models and demo will be released soon.
